# ✅ CACHE BUST SUCCESSFUL - UI FIXES NOW DEPLOYED

## What Was The Problem?
Your browser was caching the old JavaScript file (`main.2e97615f.js`) even after multiple rebuilds. The webpack hash wasn't changing because the content changes weren't significant enough to trigger a new hash.

## What Did We Do?
1. **Deleted the old build directory** completely
2. **Added substantial code changes** to force webpack to generate a new hash:
   - Added VERSION constant to QuickActions.jsx
   - Added timestamp comment to App.jsx
3. **Rebuilt with PUBLIC_URL=/scheduler** to ensure correct paths

## The Result
- **OLD FILE**: `main.2e97615f.js` (cached by your browser)
- **NEW FILE**: `main.cc7ac965.js` (fresh download required)
- **index.html**: Updated to reference the new file

## UI Fixes Included
All the following fixes are now in the new build:
- ✅ Quick Actions buttons properly sized (Grid columns: md=6, lg=4)
- ✅ Button text fits properly (responsive font sizes)
- ✅ "On-Call Board" button fully visible
- ✅ "This Week's Schedule" no longer overlapping
- ✅ Mobile-responsive layout improvements

## How To Verify
1. Navigate to: **http://localhost/scheduler/dashboard**
2. The browser will automatically download the new JavaScript file
3. You should see all buttons properly sized and text fitting

## Technical Details
- Build completed at: 11:00 AM
- New file size: 216.63 kB (gzipped)
- Cache headers in web.config: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate

## No Further Action Required
The new JavaScript file has a different filename, so browsers MUST download it. The old cached file is now irrelevant.
