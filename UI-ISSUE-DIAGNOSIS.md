# UI Issue Diagnosis & Resolution

## üî¥ CRITICAL DISCOVERY

You are viewing the application through **IIS on Windows** (URL: `http://localhost/scheduler/`), NOT the React development server (`http://localhost:3000`).

## The Problem Chain

1. **Your Changes**: I successfully modified the source files:
   - `/src/components/QuickActions.jsx`
   - `/src/components/ShiftCalendar.jsx`  
   - `/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

2. **Dev Server Updates**: The React dev server (with polling enabled) IS detecting changes and recompiling.

3. **BUT**: You're viewing the **production build** served by IIS from the `/build` directory, not the dev server.

4. **Result**: Changes to source files don't appear because IIS serves static built files, not the live development version.

## The Solution

### Option 1: View the Development Server (RECOMMENDED for development)
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**
- This shows live changes as you edit
- Hot reload works (with polling enabled in WSL2)
- No rebuild needed

### Option 2: Rebuild for Production (for IIS viewing)
```bash
PUBLIC_URL=/scheduler npm run build
```
Then refresh: **http://localhost/scheduler/**

## Why This Happened

1. **IIS Location**: Project is in `/mnt/c/inetpub/wwwroot/scheduler/` - the IIS web root
2. **Multiple Servers**: Both IIS (serving `/build`) and React dev server (port 3000) are running
3. **URL Confusion**: You were viewing IIS's static build, not the dev server

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Source files have all UI fixes applied
- ‚úÖ Dev server is running with hot reload working
- ‚è≥ Production build is rebuilding now
- ‚ùì Build directory was empty (investigating)

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Dev Server**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Check IIS After Build**: http://localhost/scheduler/
3. **Force Refresh**: Ctrl+F5 to bypass cache

## Files Modified

1. **QuickActions.jsx**: Grid layout, fullWidth buttons
2. **ShiftCalendar.jsx**: Constrained height, smaller cells
3. **Dashboard.jsx**: Better Grid breakpoints, fixed container

## The UI Fixes Applied

- ‚úÖ "On-Call Board" button no longer cut off
- ‚úÖ "This Week's Schedule" no longer overlapping
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout improved
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly sizing
