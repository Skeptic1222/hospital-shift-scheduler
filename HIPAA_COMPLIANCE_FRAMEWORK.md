# HIPAA Compliance Framework for Hospital Shift Scheduler

## Administrative Safeguards

### Security Officer Designation
- [ ] Appoint HIPAA Security Officer
- [ ] Appoint HIPAA Privacy Officer
- [ ] Document roles and responsibilities

### Workforce Training
- [ ] Create HIPAA training materials
- [ ] Implement onboarding training program
- [ ] Annual refresher training schedule
- [ ] Document training completion

### Access Management
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Unique user identification for each employee
- [ ] Automatic logoff after 15 minutes of inactivity
- [ ] Encryption of access credentials

### Audit Controls
- [ ] Hardware/software audit mechanisms
- [ ] Login monitoring and recording
- [ ] Failed login attempt tracking
- [ ] Regular audit log reviews (weekly)
- [ ] 7-year audit log retention

## Physical Safeguards

### Facility Access Controls
- [ ] Authorized personnel list
- [ ] Visitor access procedures
- [ ] Equipment inventory tracking

### Workstation Security
- [ ] Workstation use policies
- [ ] Screen lock requirements
- [ ] Mobile device management (MDM)

## Technical Safeguards

### Access Control
- [x] Unique user identification (Auth0 with MFA)
- [x] Automatic logoff (15-minute timeout)
- [x] Encryption/decryption (AES-256)

### Audit Logs Implementation
```javascript
// Required audit events
const auditEvents = {
  authentication: ['login', 'logout', 'failed_login', 'password_change'],
  dataAccess: ['view_schedule', 'modify_schedule', 'export_data'],
  administrative: ['user_created', 'user_modified', 'role_changed'],
  security: ['permission_denied', 'suspicious_activity', 'data_breach_attempt']
};
```

### Integrity Controls
- [ ] Electronic signature implementation
- [ ] Data validation mechanisms
- [ ] Error correction procedures

### Transmission Security
- [x] TLS 1.3 for all communications
- [x] End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] VPN requirements for remote access

## Organizational Requirements

### Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
- [ ] AWS HIPAA BAA
- [ ] Auth0 HIPAA BAA
- [ ] DataDog HIPAA BAA
- [ ] Email provider BAA

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] Initial risk assessment
- [ ] Annual risk assessment schedule
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning quarterly
- [ ] Penetration testing annually

### Incident Response Plan
- [ ] Breach notification procedures
- [ ] Incident response team
- [ ] 60-day breach notification requirement
- [ ] Documentation requirements

## Data Management

### Minimum Necessary Standard
- Only collect shift scheduling data
- No patient health information (PHI)
- Employee identifiers only (no SSN)

### Data Retention
- Active schedules: Real-time
- Historical schedules: 7 years
- Audit logs: 7 years
- Training records: 6 years

### Data Disposal
- [ ] Secure deletion procedures
- [ ] Certificate of destruction
- [ ] Media sanitization

## Implementation Costs

### Initial Setup
- HIPAA Compliance Consultation: $15,000
- Security Assessment: $10,000
- Policy Development: $5,000
- Training Development: $3,000
- **Total Initial: $33,000**

### Ongoing Annual
- Annual Risk Assessment: $5,000
- Penetration Testing: $8,000
- Training Updates: $2,000
- Compliance Monitoring: $10,000
- **Total Annual: $25,000**

## Certification Path

1. **Month 1-2**: Complete technical safeguards
2. **Month 2-3**: Implement administrative safeguards
3. **Month 3-4**: Conduct risk assessment
4. **Month 4-5**: Third-party security audit
5. **Month 5-6**: HITRUST CSF certification (optional but valuable)

## Compliance Monitoring Dashboard

```javascript
const complianceMetrics = {
  loginCompliance: {
    mfaAdoption: '> 95%',
    sessionTimeouts: '100%',
    passwordStrength: 'NIST 800-63B'
  },
  auditCompliance: {
    logCompleteness: '100%',
    reviewFrequency: 'Weekly',
    retention: '7 years'
  },
  trainingCompliance: {
    completion: '100%',
    refresher: 'Annual',
    documentation: 'Complete'
  }
};
```

## Critical Success Factors

1. **No PHI Storage**: Design system to work without patient data
2. **Audit Everything**: Every action must be logged
3. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data at rest and in transit
4. **Access Control**: Strict role-based permissions
5. **Training Documentation**: Prove compliance with records
